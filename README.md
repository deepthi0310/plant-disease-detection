🌿 Plant Disease Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Project Description
This project aims to detect plant diseases using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of plant leaves, the model can classify whether the plant is healthy or infected with a disease. The system helps farmers and gardeners take early action to prevent crop loss and ensure plant health.

🚀 Features
Image-based disease classification
Deep learning model (CNN) for high accuracy
Pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet, or custom CNN)
Dataset preprocessing for noise reduction
Flask or Streamlit web app for user-friendly disease prediction
Provides disease name and possible remedies
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)
Machine Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN)
Dataset: PlantVillage or a custom dataset
Web Framework: Flask/Streamlit for UI
📸 How It Works
Upload a leaf image
Model processes the image and extracts features
Prediction output: Disease name or "Healthy"
Suggests solutions for infected plants
